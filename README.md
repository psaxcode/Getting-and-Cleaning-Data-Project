Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================
The R script *run_analysis.R* does the following:

1. Loads the data sets, merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
3. Replace the activity coded with activity names.

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each  
measurement. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable  
for each activity and each subject. 

The cleaned data set is designated as *NewData.txt", which is in csv format.
