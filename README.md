Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================
The R script *run_analysis.R* does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each  
measurement. 
3. Replace the activity coded with activity names.
2. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable  
for each activity and each subject.
